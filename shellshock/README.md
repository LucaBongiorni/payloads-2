This is the log file of the POC I demonstrated in response to a tweet I saw when all the hype of shellshock was going on. 
It was articulated in a tweet that OpenVPN could be vulnerable, so I figured out how to use a shell script to validate a user and then stuffed the shellshock string into the username to spawn a reverse bash shell. This POC was then put into a sprunge.us paste and tweeted back as a response. This is now featured on @mubix github of shellshock POC's, mentioned in dozens of blogs around the world and was said to be awesome by Kevin Mitnick... Felt good as it was my first POC I had ever released.
